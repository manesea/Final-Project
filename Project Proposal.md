# Project Proposal
Recreate the arwing ship from the game Star Fox. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1QzW9hS1oo&t=38s)
Will be a model viewer and rotate around the ship. Ship will fly against background like the one in the video. Maybe add moves from the game like firing lasers or barrel rolls.

Week 1: create canvas 
Week 2: create models, make them visible under perspective projection
Week 3: create animations, add shading and lights
Week 4: finish up project, presentation prep
